NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This app solves the "I forgot what I gave Mom last Christmas" problem.

Focus on capturing information WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, not just before events.

The best gift tracker is one you actually use throughout the year.

Spouse acceptance factor: Must be easier than keeping notes in phone.

Privacy matters - not all family info should be visible to everyone.

Keep gift history forever - patterns emerge over years.
