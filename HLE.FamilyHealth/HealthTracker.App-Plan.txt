TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database Schema: PostgreSQL 'health_tracker' schema

UI Framework: Bootstrap with modern overrides (consistent with Dashboard.App)

CRITICAL Security Considerations:
- Health data is HIGHLY sensitive - encrypt at rest
- HIPAA awareness (not compliant for professional use, but respect principles)
- Strict access controls - family members may only see certain records
- Audit logging for all health record access
- Backup encryption is MANDATORY

Data Privacy:
- Children's records visible to parents until age of majority
- Adults can choose to share records with family or keep private
- Emergency access mode (bypass normal permissions in crisis)

Mobile Responsiveness:
- CRITICAL: Must be accessible on mobile for emergencies
- Quick access to vaccination cards
- Emergency info must load quickly
- Medication list must be readable on small screens

COMPLIANCE & LEGAL NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is NOT a HIPAA-compliant system (not for medical practice use).

This is for personal/family record-keeping only.

Always consult with medical professionals - this tool does not provide
medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

Users are responsible for accuracy of self-reported health information.

In emergencies, always call 911 - don't rely solely on app access.

Data privacy laws vary by region - ensure local compliance.


EMERGENCY ACCESS DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emergency Mode Features:
- PIN-less access to critical info (configurable per family)
- Printable emergency cards with QR codes
- "Ice" (In Case of Emergency) contacts
- Critical allergies and medications front-and-center
- Blood type and organ donor status clearly visible

Recommended: Physical backup (printed cards in wallets) in addition to app.


NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health data is the MOST sensitive data in this entire homelab ecosystem.

Security cannot be an afterthought - build it in from day one.

The goal is "peace of mind" - having info when you need it.

This app could literally save a life in an emergency situation.

Mobile access is not optional - it's mandatory for this use case.

Spouse acceptance factor: Must be easier than scattered papers and memory.

Test emergency access scenarios thoroughly - when you need it, it MUST work.
